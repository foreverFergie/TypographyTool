# TypographyTool User Manual

1. The GUI has a Search button that you must use to open an image containing a font.
2. The image will be previewed on the left side of the GUI and there is a Find Font button that you can press to search for what font it is.
3. Wait for the program to load the image and match the characters with the examples in the database. There will be an output that shows 3 different fonts that best match the original image.
